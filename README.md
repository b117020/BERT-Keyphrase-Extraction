# BERT-Keyphrase-Extraction
 Extracting keyphrases from Scientific text documents using BERT Pretrained model.
  I was given the task of training the model based on tuned parameters on colab to get better results.
  I have used the bert-base-multilingual-cased model for the keyphrase extraction Task 1.
